Create a generative search system capable of searching a plethora of product descriptions to find and recommend appropriate choices against a user query. You may use this Myntra dataset on Kaggle to build such a system.
The project involves two main layers the search layer and the generation layer. 
      The search layer is responsible for retrieving relevant fashion items from the dataset based on keyword matching or predefined criteria. 
      The generation layer utilizes advanced AI models like GPT-3.5 to generate detailed responses to user queries, incorporating context and generating natural language responses.
